### Support

üó™ If you would like support for this mod, please feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/hYa2sNHXya).

## Features

Prevent players from taking over Tier 4 or 5 prefabs.

### Positional Awareness

As players enter range of a tier 4 or 5 POI (either for bed or land claim), a buff notifying them of this will appear with an orange color indicating "[Blocked]" and will not disappear until they leave that prevention zone.

When a players exit a zone, the corresponding zone icon in the buff they exit will refresh with a green color indicating "[Allowed]" which will disappear within about 3 seconds.

This feature is merely for setting the right expectation and serves no other purpose beyond conveying information.

### Placement Prevention

Placing any block will trigger a check on block class and position against the existing Tier 4 and 5 POIs on the map.

If the check indicates that this block is not permitted to be placed here, that block will be removed and placed back into the player's inventory.

A notification will also trigger on the player's toolbelt to explain what just happened.
